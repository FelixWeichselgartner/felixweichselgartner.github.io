In this project I tried to use my knowledge I acquired in my 4th semester in Automatic Control Engineering I, Circuit Technology and Microcomputer Technology. This project is not supposed to be as a real quadracopter and should just be a testbench for the Arduino framework I developed.

Here are the schematics of the quadrocopter and the remote:

This is my first testbench to test the code:
