This project was a seminar work I did with 2 friends in my 6th semester for a course at my university. The project is based on [TetrisCli](https://github.com/FelixWeichselgartner/Tetris/tree/Cli) that we programmed in our 3rd semester and implements a GUI instead of the Cli.

This is how the old program looked like:

In the console we were not to get a proper framerate (as console prints are very slow) and our squares were not actual squares and rather rectangles. To fix that we used the [Qt framework](https://www.qt.io/product/framework) to create a GUI.

This is the new menu:

This is how the singleplayer looks like:

Furthermore we implemented a multiplayer with a competitive feature. Whenever one player succedes in removing 5 lines the other player gets a line inserted (with a hole) from the bottom.

## What I learned in this seminar work:
* building GUI with Qt
