A website I created to simplify getting data from customers. In the backend, the data is converted in a file format, that can be imported in my program for creating the german "Energieausweise".

The website is hosted at [PythonAnywhere](https://eu.pythonanywhere.com/), which is super easy to use with Python and Flask. You can check the website out here: [Energieausweise Online](https://www.energieausweise.online)
