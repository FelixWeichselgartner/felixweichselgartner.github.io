This project is the first Raspberry Pi based handheld console to include a GameBoy cartridge reader. The original GameBoy consists of 2 PCBs and so does the PiHeld. The Cartridge-PCB is fully tested and functional, the Display-PCB still requires some work and should be finished soon.

The project was started as a combination of my first [GameBoy Zero build](https://felixweichselgartner.github.io/2019/01/29/GameBoy_Zero.html) and a [Cartridge Reader](https://felixweichselgartner.github.io/2019/09/01/GB_Cartridge_Reader_Writer.html)
