The project is based on this [tutorial](https://www.insidegadgets.com/2011/03/19/gbcartread-arduino-based-gameboy-cart-reader-%E2%80%93-part-1-read-the-rom/) from insideGadgets.

After drawing my schematics in [Eagle](https://www.autodesk.de/products/eagle/overview), I etched my PCB like shown in these videos:

My PCB before etching looked like this:

This is after etching:

This is the top side of my circuit board:

And here the bottom side:

With this self-build Arduino Uno shield I dumped my cartridge of Yoshi's Cookie (MBC1) and I was later able to play it on my own Emulator:

However, so far I was not able to dump games with MBC5 (like the Pok√©mon games).
